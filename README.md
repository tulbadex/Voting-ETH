## Technical Architecture <a name="technical-architecture"></a>
BlockVote uses the following technologies:

### Frontend
- **HTML5/CSS3**: Application structure and styling
- **JavaScript/ES6**: Application logic and interactions
- **Ethers.js v6**: Blockchain interaction library
- **Font Awesome**: Icon library

### Blockchain
- **Ethereum Sepolia Testnet**: Blockchain network
